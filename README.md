# Virtual-Physics-Lab

This is a virtual physics simulation web app made by using javascript and Draw2d.js.

Our site is live at https://andc-lab.netlify.app/

# üéØ Problem Statement :-

<p>Our goal is to create a Virtual Physics Lab Software that offers an engaging and authentic simulation environment for students to conduct physics experiments. The platform should incorporate realistic physics simulations, interactive elements, and intuitive controls to provide an immersive learning experience. It should also include a wide range of experiments and measurements, as well as data analysis tools, to help students understand and apply fundamental physics principles. The goal is to design a user-friendly and feature-rich virtual physics lab that promotes active learning and facilitates the exploration of various physics concepts in a virtual setting.</p>

# üîß Tech Stack Used :-

<strong>MERN Stack</strong>
<ol>
<li>Tailwind CSS => for designing the UI/UX</li>
<li>React js => for creating the software (especially circuit simulator)</li>
<li>Node js => for creating a server for this software</li>
<li>Express js => for doing all the stuff in backend</li>
<li>MongoDB => for creating a database (if required)</li>
<li>Firebase => Will use it to store user data</lo>
</ol>


# üí∞ Cost Estimate :-

Cost = Effort(pm) * Developer Charge(INR/pm)
<br>
Cost = 8.62 * 25,000
<br>
Cost = Rs 2,15,000

#  üé¨ Demo :-

# ‚ö° Challenges Faced :-

<ol>
<li>Drag & Drop functionality of circuit simulator was the most difficult part of this project.</li>
<li>Connecting the two components together in circuit simulator was a big challange for us.</li>
</ol>
