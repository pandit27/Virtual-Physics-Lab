# 🎯 Problem Statement :-

<p>Our goal is to create a Virtual Physics Lab Software that offers an engaging and authentic simulation environment for students to conduct physics experiments. The platform should incorporate realistic physics simulations, interactive elements, and intuitive controls to provide an immersive learning experience. It should also include a wide range of experiments and measurements, as well as data analysis tools, to help students understand and apply fundamental physics principles. The goal is to design a user-friendly and feature-rich virtual physics lab that promotes active learning and facilitates the exploration of various physics concepts in a virtual setting.</p>

# 🔧 Tech Stack Used :-

<strong>MERN Stack</strong>
<ol>
<li>Tailwind CSS => for designing the UI/UX</li>
<li>React js => for creating the software (especially circuit simulator)</li>
<li>Node js => for creating a server for this software</li>
<li>Express js => for doing all the stuff in backend</li>
<li>MongoDB => for creating a database (if required)</li>
</ol>


# 💰 Cost Estimate :-

Cost = Effort(pm) * Developer Charge(INR/pm)
<br>
Cost = 8.62 * 25,000
<br>
Cost = Rs 2,15,000
